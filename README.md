### Horticultural Variables Problem Sketch
1. Horticultural communities + data <br>
  a. What will access to food look like in communities that do not have access to information to grow food? <br>
  b. What does an educated and engaged gardening community look like? <br>
  c. How to distribute complex information in a way that makes it usable for non-subject matter experts? <br>
  d. Example communities + engagement <br>

    - [OpenFarm](https://openfarm.cc/)
2. Horticultural data for education <br>
  a. What variables are shared across different communities? <br>
  b. Which variables need a lot of expertise to understand? Which do not? <br>
  c. Which variables need to be understood/explored/considered together? <br>
  d. Sources <br>
