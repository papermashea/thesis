## Horticultural Variables Problem Sketch
### Horticultural communities + data
1. What will access to food look like in communities that do not have access to information to grow food?
2. What does an educated and engaged gardening community look like?
3. How to distribute complex information in a way that makes it usable for non-subject matter experts?
4. Example communities + engagement
- https://garden.org/
- https://www.growstuff.org/
- https://openfarm.cc/
### Horticultural data for education
1. What variables are shared across different communities?
2. Which variables need a lot of expertise to understand? Which do not?
3. Which variables need to be understood/explored/considered together?
4. Sources
- Plants for a future
- USDA
- https://garden.org/plants
